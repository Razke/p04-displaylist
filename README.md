# About
  Objective: design and layout a music playing app that displays the list of available songs in a ListView or a GridView, navigates to a details screen of the currently playing song, and uses explicit intents to navigate around the app.

Data about each song should be stored in a custom class that is retrieved and displayed via a Loop and Adapter.

For this project, **the actual music playing functionality won't be implemented.**

## Reflections

* Got a thin grasp about using Arrays, Adapters and ListViews together.

* Rubric guidelines seem to elude me sometimes.
